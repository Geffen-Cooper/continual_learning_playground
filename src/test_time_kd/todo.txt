Q1. test cosine similarity between two untrained domains in successsion
    -a:does fine-tuning on a domain enable distinction between it and other domains
    -b:how much fine-tuning is required
    -c:do we finetune by minimizing cosine similarity or something else
    -d:how does this apply to other datasets
    -e:what if the student model did not start from the teacher initialization (e.g. we use v3_small as student)

A1. we don't need to test cosine similarity between two untrained domains in successsion because looking at the plots from before
    we can see the cosine similarity is close to zero for all corruptions so we won't see a transition

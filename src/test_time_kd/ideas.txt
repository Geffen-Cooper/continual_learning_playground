Q: How do we flag uncertain regions? We can not purely rely on confidence-label alignment because there
   may be a point with high confidence correctly classified and a point right next to it with high confidence
   incorrectly classified. We need to find and define regions where there is high uncertainty about whether
   the point is correctly classified despite confidence.

    We need to first define what high uncertainty means. An point that is high uncertainty is one for which
    the confidence disagees strongly with its ground truth label (Note that this does not necesarily mean
    that a point with high confidence with correct label is high certainty because two such point could be close).
    Maybe a better definition is a point whose nearest neighbor has a different class but the points have similar
    confidence distributions and are classified the same.
